Description: A four-function one-run calculator on the command line. The program
will first prompt the user for two numbers, then display a menu with five operations. It will allow the
user to select an option by reading input. The program will then display the result of the operation and
exit. The project is designed to give students an opportunity to practice input, output, selection, and
basic operators via a simple program

# Getting two number inputs from the user
num_one = float(input('Enter first operand: '))
num_two = float(input('Enter second operand: '))

# Calculator options

print('Calculator Menu')
print('---------------')
print('1. Addition')
print('2. Subtraction')
print('3. Multiplication')
print("4. Division")
print('Which operation do you want to perform? ', end='')
option = int(input())

# Operations
if option == 1:
    sum = num_one + num_two
    print('The result of the operation is ', sum, '. Goodbye!')
elif option == 2:
    sum = num_one - num_two
    print('The result of the operation is ', sum, '. Goodbye!')
elif option == 3:
    sum = num_one * num_two
    print('The result of the operation is ', sum, '. Goodbye!')
elif option == 4:
    sum = num_one/num_two
    print('The result of the operation is ', sum, '. Goodbye!')
else:
    print('Error: Invalid selection! Terminating program.')
